<br />

In connection with Kia Connect we collect and process your personal data only insofar as the collection and processing is necessary for the conclusion or the performance of the UVO contract (Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR), or legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR). For further details on individual Kia Connect services, please consult the respective service description in the Kia Connect Terms of Use. The (personal) data described in this Section 4 below is collected directly from the car’s head unit and is processed in connection with the Kia Connect services.<br />
<br />

 
We will further analyse and improve the Services to develop new mobility and mobility related products and/or services, to secure our products and/or to improve our services. For these purposes, we automatically analyse the data based on statistical and mathematical models to identify potential for improvements.<br />
<br />

 
The data described in this Section 4 below is required to provide the Kia Connect services. Without the respective information, the Kia Connect services cannot be performed.<br />
<br />

 
We process your personal data for other purposes only if we are obligated to do so on the basis of legal requirements (for example, transfer to courts or criminal prosecution authorities), if you have consented to the respective processing or if the processing is otherwise lawful under applicable law. If processing for another purpose takes place we will provide you with additional information, if appropriate. We do not engage in automated decision-making including profiling in connection with the Kia Connect services unless we have expressly notified you of such automated decision-making including profiling by other means.<br />
<br />

 
<b>4.1 Kia Live</b>
<br />
<br />

 
Kia Live enables you to access the following functions:<br />
<br />

 
• Traffic: Live traffic information to calculate routes and display traffic situation. Online Navigation enables the User to navigate to their desired destination based on the combination of real-time traffic data and historical traffic information.<br />

• Live point of interest (POI): Information on nearby POI based on current position<br />

• Weather: Local weather information<br />

• Parking: On and Off Street parking based on current position, nearby destination, nearby scrolled mark, nearby city center<br />

• EV POI (only for Electric Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles): Information on nearby charging stations including availability status based on current position<br />

• Dealer point of interest (POI): Kia nearby dealer location information based on nearby current position<br />

• Camera/danger zone alerts (if legally permissible in your country): The system provides alerts in areas where accidents are particularly common and warns You about accident black spots or speed cameras<br />
<br />

 
<u>For this purpose the following categories of personal data are processed for the conclusion or the performance of the contract:</u>
 (GPS) Location data, service requests and responses for server search (point of interest (POI) data), dealer POI data, fuel-related information, parking-related information, speed camera information, electric vehicle (EV) station information, weather information), traffic information, unit of distance (km, miles, meters), language settings, telecom carrier information, unique identifiers (e.g. Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), Driver ID, Service ID), phone number, date and local time, protocol version, navigation device information (e.g. hardware version, software version), route information (e.g. start point, settings, goal point, estimated time).<br />
<br />

 
In addition, the GPS data (location) and the Service ID will be collected and stored for up to 93 days in order to improve the Kia Live service, based on legitimate interests. More information on the balancing test is available upon request.<br />
<br />

 
<b>4.2 Online Voice Recognition</b>
<br />
<br />

 
Online Voice Recognition enables you to use spoken commands to access and control Kia Live services and draft and send text messages via a connected mobile device. Upon the activation of Kia Connect in your vehicle, Online Voice Recognition is activated as a default setting. When using Online Voice Recognition, your personal data will be processed in an online environment.<br />
<br />

 
<u>For this purpose the following categories of personal data are processed for the conclusion or the performance of the contract:</u>
 Voice recording, GPS data (location), <u>unique identifiers</u>
 (e.g. Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), Service ID).<br />
<br />

 
The recorded voice samples are transferred together with the GPS data and the Service ID to our relevant service provider. Our service provider for the Online Voice Recognition is Cerence B.V., CBS Weg 11, 6412EX Heerlen, Netherlands (processor) (&quot;Cerence&quot;) and its sub-processors, which may be located in countries outside the EU/EEA and may not provide for an adequate level of data protection. Cerence transforms the voice samples into text samples, semantically interpreting them (if necessary), and then sends the result back to the vehicle.<br />
<br />

 
In addition, voice samples and GPS data will be collected and stored for up to 90 days in order to perform and improve the Online Voice Recognition service based on legitimate interests. More information on the balancing test is available upon request.<br />
<br />

 
You can prevent the transfer of your personal data (i.e. voice samples) to Cerence by deactivating the Online Voice Recognition in the respective settings of your head unit. By deactivating the Online Voice Recognition the functionality of the voice recognition may be limited or disabled.<br />
<br />

 
<b>4.3 Notification Center</b>
<br />
<br />

 
Notification Center enables the User to receive messages from Kia on the head unit screen.
For this purpose the following categories of personal data are processed for the conclusion or the performance of the contract: unique identifiers (e.g. Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)), sequenceID, read status, UTC time.<br />
<br />

 
<b>4.4 Valet Parking Mode</b>
<br />
<br />

 
When activated and the vehicle is driven by another person, the User can monitor the vehicle location, the time ignition was turned off last, driving time, driving distance and top speed (please refer to Section 4 of the Privacy Notice - Kia Connect App). This information is also displayed on the head unit screen.<br />
<br />

 
For this purpose the following categories of personal data are necessarily processed: <u>unique identifiers (e.g. Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)),</u>
 valet mode status information (activation status, valet mode starting and ending time, run time, mileage time, idle engine time, maximum speed, run distance), vehicle indicators (location, speed, time, accuracy, direction).<br />
<br />

 
<b>5. Your Rights</b>

<b>6. Recipients and Categories of Recipients</b>
<br />

Any access to your personal data at Kia is restricted to those individuals that have a need to know in order to fulfill their job responsibilities.<br />
<br />

 
Kia may transfer your personal data for the respective purposes to the recipients and categories of recipients listed below:<br />
<br />

 
• <u>Private third parties</u>
 – Affiliated or unaffiliated private bodies other than us that alone or jointly with others, determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
For the purpose of providing Kia Connect we need to transfer data (e.g. to our data processors – see below). For this technical service we rely on telecommunication services provided by telecommunication providers (currently Vodafone GmbH, Ferdinand-Braun-Platz 1, 40549 Dusseldorf, Germany).<br />

• <u>Data processors</u>
 – Certain third parties, whether affiliated or unaffiliated, may receive your personal data to process such data on behalf of Kia under appropriate instructions as necessary for the respective processing purposes. The data processors will be subject to contractual obligations to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard the personal data, and to process the personal data only as instructed.<br />

 as required or permitted by applicable law.
 
<b>7. Cross-Border Data Transfer</b>
<br />

Some of the recipients of your personal data will be located or may have relevant operations outside of your country and the EU/EEA, e.g. in the Republic of Korea or the United States of America (e.g. Cerence’s subprocessors), where the data protection laws may provide a different level of protection compared to the laws in your jurisdiction and with regard to which an adequacy decision by the European Commission does not exist. With regard to data transfers to such recipients outside of the EU/EEA we provide appropriate safeguards, in particular, by way of entering into data transfer agreements adopted by the European Commission (e.g. Standard Contractual Clauses (2010/87/EU and/or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients or taking other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection. A copy of the respective measure we have taken is available via our data protection officer (see 3.2 above).<br />

8.1 Your personal data is stored by Kia and/or our service providers, strictly to the extent necessary for the performance of our obligations and strictly for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which the personal data is collected, in accordance with applicable data protection laws. When Kia no longer needs to process your personal data, we will erase it from our systems and/or records and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it (unless we need to keep your information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which Kia is subject; e.g., personal data contained in contracts, communications, and business letters may be subject to statutory retention requirements, which may require retention of up to 10 years).<br />
<br />

 
8.2 Where no legal or regulatory retention periods apply, as a rule, all personal data processed in connection with the provision of Kia Connect is deleted or anonymized immediately after provision of the individual Kia Connect services action has been completed with the following exceptions:<br />
<br />

 
• Sign-up and Log-in data are stored for the duration of the contract (i.e. up to seven years)<br />

• Online Voice Recognition: Voice samples and GPS data (see 4.2 above) are stored up to 90 days<br />

• Kia Live: GPS data and Service ID (see 4.1 above) are stored up to 93 days<br />
<br />

 
<u>8.3 Reset of account:</u>
 Your account may be reset by setting the respective preference (e.g. in the vehicle's head unit). In such case, all personal data related to your account will be deleted, unless retention periods apply (see 8.1 above). Upon reset of the account, you will be logged out of Kia Connect and will have to perform a new sign-up procedure or log in with different credentials if you intend to use Kia Connect.<br />
<br />

 
<b>9. Offline Mode (Modem Off)</b>
<br />

You may choose to activate Offline Mode by setting the respective preference. If Offline Mode is turned on all Kia Connect functions are disabled and no personal data, in particular no location data (GPS), is collected for Kia Connect and an Offline Mode icon is displayed at the top of the head unit screen in the vehicle. <br />

All rights in the App Services, the underlying software, the content and arrangement are owned by Kia Group and its licensors.

You are obligated to comply with applicable law and respect the rights of third parties when using the App Services.<br />
<br />

 
<b>6. Free App Services</b>
<br />

The App Services are provided free of charge for a period of 7 years commencing on the day the vehicle is sold to the first owner of the vehicle, i.e. the point in time the initial purchase agreement becomes effective. We reserve the right to propose additional services in the future subject to separate terms of use.<br />
<br />

 
<b>7. Uptime</b>
<br />

7.1. We reserve the right to temporarily or permanently deactivate access to the App Services in whole or in part for technical and security reasons (e.g. in the event of gaps in security) and other important reasons.<br />
<br />

 
7.2. The provision and use of the App Services may be subject to restrictions with regard to the current state of the art beyond the scope of our control. This relates in particular to the availability of the data connections provided by carriers. In individual cases, the non-availability of the network can lead to the App Services not being available as the necessary data transfer cannot occur. In addition, short-term capacity bottlenecks can arise from peak loads on the App Services, wireless and fixed networks and on the Internet.<br />
<br />

 
7.3. Disruptions can also arise due to force majeure, including pandemic and epidemic diseases, strikes, lockouts and official orders, and on account of technical and other measures (e.g. repairs, maintenance, software updates, and extensions) necessary on our systems or those of downstream or upstream providers, content providers and network operators, which are necessary for the proper or improved performance of the App Services.<br />
<br />

 
7.4. Where access to the App Services is deactivated, restricted or disrupted as described in this Section 7, to the extent possible we will contact you in advance to inform you of this and give a reason for the deactivation, restriction or disruption.<br />
<br />

 
<b>8. Data Protection</b>
<br />

For information on how we collect and process personal data in connection with the provision of the App Services please refer to our Privacy Notice - Kia Connect App.<br />
<br />

 
The User shall inform any other user/driver of the vehicle that the App Services are activated. The User shall in particular inform such other user/driver about the data processing activities described in the Privacy Notice - Kia Connect App and the fact that the App Services require the collection and processing of location data (GPS data).<br />
<br />

 
<b>9. Term, Termination</b>
<br />

9.1. You may use the App Services as of the day you registered for the Kia Account and accepted these Terms of Use.<br />
<br />

 
9.2. The right to use the App Services commences on the day the vehicle is sold to the first owner of the vehicle, i.e. the point in time the initial purchase agreement becomes effective, and automatically expires after 7 years.<br />
<br />

 
9.3. The agreement concerning the provision of the App Services and thereby the right to use the App Services can be terminated by You at any time with 6 weeks’ notice, to the end of a calendar quarter.<br />
<br />

 
9.4. Either party's right to terminate for good cause remains unaffected.<br />
<br />

 
9.5. Furthermore, in the event of the reversal of the purchase agreement for a vehicle, the reacquisition or other withdrawal of the vehicle by the relevant dealer, in the event of the termination of a leasing agreement, in case of sale of the vehicle to a third party, in case of theft, as well as in the event of total damage beyond repair, each party shall be entitled to the termination of the App Services with regard to the vehicle concerned. The termination shall become valid as soon as one party receives the notice of termination. In case of sale or transfer of possession of the vehicle to a third party, the User shall delete the data stored in the vehicle.<br />
<br />

 
9.6. We reserve the right to temporarily or permanently block and/or revoke the use of the App Services in case of material breach of these Terms of Use and, in case of material breach by the User of these Terms of Use, to terminate the contract.<br />
<br />

 
<b>10. Changes to the Terms of Use</b>
<br />

10.1. Kia reserves the right to make reasonable changes to the Terms of Use and/or to the App Services. The User will be notified by us about any changes to these Terms of Use and/or the App Services. If the User does not reject to those changes in text form (e.g. email, fax) within 4 weeks after receipt of the notification, the changes are deemed to be agreed. We will expressly notify the User about the right to reject and the consequences of being silent.<br />
<br />

 
10.2. If the User rejects, we reserve the right to terminate any right to use the affected App Service(s) with 6 weeks’ notice, to the end of a calendar quarter.<br />
<br />

 
<b>11. Miscellaneous</b>
<br />

11.1. These Terms of Use are the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of the use of the App Services and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter.<br />
<br />

 
11.2. Deviating, conflicting or supplementing terms and conditions of the User shall only govern the use of the App Services if explicitly accepted by us in writing.<br />
<br />

 
11.3. Any amendments and additions to the Terms of Use as well as notifications necessary for their execution require text form (including email, fax) to be effective. The text form requirement can only be overruled in text form.<br />
<br />

 
11.4. We are entitled to assign our rights and duties under this agreement either in full or in part to another service provider by providing 6 weeks’ notice to the User. In this case, however, the User shall be entitled to terminate the agreement within one month after receipt of the written notification effective at the time of the intended assignment of the agreement to the company which is taking over the place of Kia in the agreement. We shall expressly inform the User of this right of termination in the written notification. For the avoidance of doubt, this right is without prejudice to your right to terminate the Terms of Use and thereby the right to use the App Services at any time upon 6 weeks’ notice as stipulated in Section 9.3.<br />
<br />

<br />

12.1. Users may use the contact details set out in Section 1 above in case of questions or complaints.<br />

<br />

 
<b>13. No right of withdrawal</b>
<br />

The User does not have a right of withdrawal. This applies even in case the User is a consumer, because the App Services are provided free of charge.<br />
<br />

 
<b>14. Liability</b>
<br />

The following liability applies to You as per country in which You have your habitual residence:<br />
